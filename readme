The tool I have created is a mixture of UI builder and some custom made elements in c#. It is made to make the process of playtesting and balancing easier

It can be accessed and tinkered with in Assets/Game/Tool/GameConfig.asset

The tool itself is a custom inspector for a ScriptableObject called GameConfig, which contains several variables affecting different aspects of the game.

Some of the variables work as initial values for scriptable variables such as health and time. Variables like these exist in form of assets within the components folder
but all variables affecting gameplay should be changed within the overall configuration.

The config itself can also be created as a new asset but in case you want several config assets to choose from you would need to replace the config in each gameObject/prefab
with a reference to it.
